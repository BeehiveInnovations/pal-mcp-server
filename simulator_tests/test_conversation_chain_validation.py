Conversation Chain and Threading Validation Test

This test validates that:
1. Multiple tool invocations create proper parent->parent->parent chains
2. New conversations can be started independently
3. Original conversation chains can be resumed from any point
4. History traversal works correctly for all scenarios
5. Thread relationships are properly maintained in Redis

Test Flow:
Chain A: chat -> analyze -> debug (3 linked threads)
Chain B: chat -> analyze (2 linked threads, independent)
Chain A Branch: debug (continue from original chat, creating branch)

This validates the conversation threading system's ability to:
- Build linear chains
- Create independent conversation threads
- Branch from earlier points in existing chains
- Properly traverse parent relationships for history reconstruction
